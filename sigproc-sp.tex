% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.

% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:

\title{Matain-e-nator: \ttlit{Make the World a Better Place}}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{3} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the

\begin{abstract}
Our goal is to improve the overall quality of a facility as well as decrease an organization’s overall operating expenses. 
By letting those who maintain facilities know about problems sooner. They can react quicker and more efficiently if they have better information about the status of their facilities. 
\textit{Maintain-e-nator} provides a cell phone application to report problems as well as a web interface to 
allow maintenance workers to be notified of new problems.

% INTRODUCTION
%==========
\section{Introduction}
Eventually everything breaks. Nothing lasts forever. Buildings start as brand new but eventually break down. 
Roads start as smooth, but eventually develop potholes. 
These breakdowns can sometimes be ignored like a squeaky door, but others can cause safety and health risks. 
If the stairs of a building are in disrepair they could cause a tripping hazard for other people.

%==========
% Motivation
%==========
\section{Motivations}
It is easy for a large organization to be unaware of all the maintenance problems that their facilities have. 
Some obscure room may need a light bulb replaced but those that work in that area do not report the problem or are not around when the build is exhibiting its behaviors. 
So the people who take a night class are the only ones aware of the problem. 
They do not know where to submit a problem and are often not willing to do the necessary research to find out how to report a problem.

These problems are not limited to the indoors. They can also involve roads, landscaping, sidewalks, outdoor sports facilities.

\subsection{What is a problem?}
We consider a maintenance problem anything that can hurt someone as well as something that detracts from the overall quality of the facilities. 
So a dirty floor or table could be considered a problem. 
At the end of the day the users who submit a problem are the ones who are deciding what a problem is. 
Who better to determine a problem then those who actually use the facilities?

\subsection{Goal}
The overall goal is to make maintenance workers aware of the problems that exists on their property. 
Are android application and web interface will not promise cleaner facilities. Our goal is to help those that manage a property.

%==========
% DESIGN
%==========
\section{Design}
Our application comprises of two part: the Android App and the backend provide the web service. 
submitter and maintainer.
\ldots

\subsection{Android App}
We programmed our app\footnote{\url{https://github.com/forkloop/Maintain-e-nator}} on the Android~\cite{android} platform.
Our app mainly has three modules:
\begin{inparaenum}
 \item login module
 \item localization module
 \item information module
 \end{inparaenum}\\
 Below we talk about these three modules in detail.
 \subsubsection{Login}
 Whenever some user wants to submit issues and open the app, she can choose to log in the app with her Google account or anonymously.
 We choose Google account because it is available in (or necessary for ) every Android device. We add some personal decorations for user
 logs in with Google account, and once the user submit an issue, we will also pass their personal information (i.e., name and email address)
 to backend server, which maybe used in the future for contacting with the user. Oauth part \ldots 

\subsubsection{Localization}
 % move to localization part
 Each time when a submitter open the activity for filling an issue, the app will start to request a single location update via 
 Network or GPS. We prefer Network over GPS for it is much faster and accurate enough with the omni Wi-Fi APs within campus.
 Also since it is unlikely for the submitter to move around when submitting an issue, we only request \textit{single} location update 
 to save battery life. 
 If the submitter is indoor, we will try to guess which hall she maybe in by calculating the Euclidean distance between current geolocation 
 and some predefined geolocations of halls we current support, and find the smallest one which could be the hall the submitter is in. 
 However, if the submitter is outdoor, we will try to get a meaningful location of the submitter by using 
 Google Place API~\cite{google-place} with current geolocation data. 
 
 \subsubsection{Info}
 For future maintainers can locate the issue position accurately and easily, we hope submitters can report the issue location 
 as detail as possible. Since the location for indoor and outdoor could be very different, to ease the process the filling the detail
 of an issue, we has two different forms for indoor and outdoor separately, as Fig~\ref{fig:form}. 
 \begin{figure*}[!hbt]

 However, if the submitter is outdoor, we will try to get a meaningful location of the submitter by using 
 Google Place API~\cite{google-place} with current geolocation data. 
 
Only text may not be that descriptive when describing an issue, thus we also encourage submitter to add photos and 
even an audio recording regarding the location or issue detail. By \texttt{long-press} the image area, 
the submitter can add up to three photos either from camera capture or gallery. Of course the submitter can view the full-size photo by
~\texttt{clicking} it and decide whether to keep it or replace it with a new one. Also, when submitter \texttt{holding} the recording button,
the app will recording the audio in \texttt{wav} format. We choose \texttt{wav} because it is the quick and dirty way to enable the recorded
audio can be played back both on Android and browser. The supported recording formats on Android (or to our best knowledge on Nexus S)
, e.g., \texttt{mp4}, \texttt{\ldots} are not supported by current browsers. While the other formats supported by browser without any plugins,
\texttt{mp3, ogg} need third-party native libraries to be recorded on Android devices. 

\subsubsection{Others}

\subsection{Backend}
We use~\cite{django} as our web server framework.

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.

\section{Acknowledgments}
This section is optional; it is a location for you
to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
what have you.  In the present case, for example, the
authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.
